NES Palettes for Graphics Editing Software
v1.1

  The first release was a little borked because a friend of mine (Tootai)
noticed that there weren't any yellow colors when I swore I've played
games with yellow in them.  Unfortunately after I updated the palettes
It turns out that there AREN'T any true yellows.  Just limey-yellow
colors.  BMF's NTSC palette is the most accurate, so I ripped the values
out of his.
  I also included PAL palettes done by Matrixz as well.  Fun fun, eh?
Hopefully people can start making original NES graphics for webcomics 
and homebrew videogames easier now.  Perhaps somebody can edit the
source to BMP2NES by 7h1460 to include palette generating too, now :)
  What I've learned from this is that NTSC has no good yellows, and PAL
has no true whites.

  BIG thanks go to BMF (http://bmf.rustedmagick.com) for the NTSC palette,
Matrixz (http://matrixz.8m.net) for the PAL palette.  Thanks to Tootai
for spotting the "mistake".  Lastly, all the people at #nesdev for dealing
with my ignorant bitching.

Thanks everybody!
