NES

Fails on CPU blargg test 5 unofficial opcodes SXA
TODO: Sprite DMA needs to react on instruction complete, not the instant the register is written to


SNES

The M and X flags are always equal
to one in the Emulation mode. When an interrupt occurs during the Emulation
mode, the Break flag is written to stack memory as bit 4 of the Processor
Status Register.

During the Emulation mode, the Stack Pointer high-order byte
(SH) is always equal to 01. The Bank Address is 00 for all Stack operations.

Does emulation mode cause 8 bit wrap around on zero page addressing?

TSC: While in 6502 emulation mode a one will be transferred to the hidden B (upper 8 bits) accumulator because the stack is always located at page one in 6502 mode.
Dont understand??

TCS: Should the top 8 bits of the stack pointer be cleared in this instance?

Check mapping behaviour of AMS_ABSOLUTE_INDIRECT_DIRECT

need to decrement program bank register if going below zero when jumping?
set data bank register with MVN/MVP?


Should BRL / other branch commands cross program bank boundaries? Apparently old branch commands behave the same as 6502


 When switching from 8 to 16 or 16 to 8 bit index register, the high byte of either X or Y will be come zero.
Needs doing - uses same status register in emu - While in emulation mode (E=1) bit 4 is the B BRK flag bit. [While in emulation mode, bit 5 is not present.]
[The stack pointer is returned to eights bits with the high byte forced to one and the high byte is lost.]

	
 1A      INC     Accumulator (INA)              1       2 |
	62      PER     Stack (PC Relative Long) 
	D4      PEI     Stack (Direct Page Indirect)   2       6 | 2

	 check JMP/JSR addressing
	 

Have zero clock cycles:
WDM
MVP
MVN

Dynamic clock cycles need doing

signature byte for brk / cop
confustion over ADC how it behaves in 8bit acc mode
BIT does not store overflow / carry flags in immediate addressing
COP native mode decimal flag should be cleared after execution
JML - subtract program counter (already been incremented before call?)

got as far as jumps / LDA



=====================================================

Tests failing:

cli_latency_tests #3
APU should generate IRQ when $4017 = $00

Fails all mmc3_irq_tests tests

Fails nes_vbl_nmi_tests #07 : 55259094

Fails nes-stress PPU test 2: sprites on all

Fails all pal-apu tests

'Paltest' has jittery lines when i guess its not supposed to

'scanline' test passes first 2 tests but cant read third line - confirm on other emu to test

'stretch.nes' has jittery lines, confirm behaviour


Current testing:

Got to usa\Batman Returns (U)

done: sprite hit detection - use pre-render buffer
done: APU support
DONE: fix palette colours - balloon fight logo should be orange not blue
DONE: savestate support
FIXED: ppu frame tests fail after loading a few roms - state not properly being reset - possible not reseting cpu ticks on reset?
FIXED - need way of setting priority buffer for sprites - sprite zero not being correctly identified
DONE - remove subcycle and affect parameters from memory reads
DONE - remove boost shared_ptrs from mainboard components and make the global pointers instead
DONE - replace if() tests with asserts for pointer testing

FIXED - japan\gyrodine (helicopter changes colour)
FIXED - usa\donkey kong (marios face changes colour on second level)
FIXED - allowing more than 8 sprites on a scanline fixes this - mapper1\usa\abadox - sprites flicker when many on a line
FIXED - mapper1\usa\chessmaster
FIXED - mapper1\usa\clash at demonhead
FIXED - mapper1\usa\desert commander - resets on start game
FIXED + mapper1\usa\Clash At Demonhead (U).nes - supposed to be black background on text in intro screen? - yes
FIXED - individual mappers need to save state (reboot on die hard (U) after reloading save state - patterns messed up - see 65EEC6E7_1.savestate on desktop)
FIXED - Ironsword - Wizards & Warriors 2 (U).nes - shaky status bar (mapper #2, must be spritezero hit detection problem)
DONE - save all options on options dialog close (also set current options on load)
DONE - use Reset event on mainboard, hook all components on that, stop recreating all components on reset & reload
DONE - look into zapper code
DONE: fix status register errors in nesstress CPU tests
DONE - move all joystick stuff from cpumemory into proper class
DONE: properly clear memory on cold reboot

/////////////// debug ideas

- sprite & bg tile numbering
- separate opengl context so can render nametables & palette on tother window


high: monochrome + emphasis support
high: mega man 3 issues: http://nesdev.parodius.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=212 <- 513 cycles for DMA??
high: sort out dont allow writes to PRG & CHR ROM
high: sound IRQ & CLI latency implementation
- tidy up sprite DMA transfer & optimise

low pri: iNES trainer support: http://nesdev.parodius.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=1804

high: add own assert() method to be turned on / off via #define
high: assert on renderbuffer->prioritybuffer and any memory pages

Test mapper #8
[ Several hacked Japanese titles use this mapper, such as the hacked version of Doraemon. ]

+ mapper #11
[ This mapper is used on several unlicensed Color Dreams titles, including Crystal Mines and Pesterminator.
	I'm not sure if their religious ("Wisdom Tree") games use the same mapper or not. ]
+ mapper #13 (videomation)
DONE, DONE + mapper #15 (no support for 8k prg switching - TODO, incomplete)
+ mapper #17 [ Several hacked Japanese titles use this mapper, such as the hacked versions of Parodius and DragonBall Z 3. ]
 + mapper #66, 78, 69 (IRQs!)
 + mapper #6, implement IRQ overflow thingy majig for FFE games ( http://nocash.emubase.de/everynes.htm )
 
DONE - add support for 1k + 2k VROM switching, and 8k prg
- dont allow writes to VROM
DONE - dont automatically setup VRAM in default mapper

- add option to set power-up state (currently cpuram all set to zero)


wxZipInputStream - read from zip files
